        <h3>What is Lutris ?</h3>
        <p>
        Lutris is a gaming platform aiming to support as many games as possible
        for the GNU/Linux operating system. It takes care of running the game
        by setting up the best environement in order to provide the most
        enjoyable gaming experience.<br/>
        The program is currently usable but only has a fraction of the planned
        features. The best is yet to come!

        <h3>You can help !</h3>
        <p>
        Lutris is Open Source Software and is under a GPL v3 License.
        Contributors are more than welcome as I has lots of work elsewhere too
        and I'm not able to devote 100% of my time to Lutris ;)
        You don't have to be a Python expert to help, just run the program,
        report bugs, submit your ideas, etc ...<br/>
        If you happen to be a Python hacker then Lutris is a fun project to work
        on. I try to keep the code clean and understandable. If you read the code and
        find some things that are badly designed or could be improved, don't
        hesitate to point them out.<br/>
        There is all you need to start contributing right now ! If you have
        <em>any</em> question about Lutris' source code, get in touch with me
        and I'll happily guide you.
        </p>
