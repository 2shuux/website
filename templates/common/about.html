      <p>
        Lutris is a gaming client for Linux. It gives you access to all your
        video games with the exception of the current console generation.  You
        can, in a single interface, run any game from your childhood memories
        to the current multiplayer games.

        Integrations with stores like GOG and Steam allow you to import your
        existing game library and community maintained install scripts give you
        a completely automated setup.

        Lutris uses what we  refer as runners. Runners are programs that the
        client can control and launch. Our most popular runners include
        RetroArch, DosBox, FS-UAE, ScummVM, MESS, Dolphin and of course Wine TkG,
        a build of Wine optimized to give you the best performance out of your
        system.

        It is also possible to launch Linux native games, we have a large
        selection of free and Open Source games ready to install from the
        client. Download the client and start playing in minutes!

      <p>
        Video games are now part of our history and our culture. If we want to keep a
        trace of the actual games and not just videos or articles about them, we need
        have a way to play them in a way that would closely match how the game was
        meant to be experienced. We also need to make sure that the games we have today
        still work tomorrow. This is why the choice of Linux as a gaming environment is
        so important. In a closed ecosystem, our legacy is at the mercy of software
        vendors able to kill features required to run some games. While we cannot
        support each and every recent AAA release, mostly due to DRM and anti-cheat
        incompatibilities, Lutris does support a vast majority of every game ever
        released in history, on a wide variety of hardware systems.

        Mathieu Comandon (aka Strider, or Strycore when “this username is not
        available”) has been experimenting with Linux since 1997 and became a
        full time user in 2006, driven away from Windows by the Vista
        announcements and a general desire to take control back over his
        machines.
      </p>

        Back in 2006, playing games on Linux wasn’t an easy or necessarily fun
        task. Native ports were rare, we still had support from id Software
        with ports of id Tech 4 games like Prey and Quake 4 but that was pretty
        much it. Other options for gaming were playing open source games,
        emulators or using wine, which was still struggling with DirectX 9
        games at the time. Another product would later appear: Cedega, a
        proprietary UI for a patched version of Wine (previously known as
        WineX). This would let you play games such as Left 4 Dead and Call of
        Duty 4 on Linux.
      </p>

        Seeing the potential of Linux as a gaming platform but being frustrated
        by spending so much time setting up games, Mathieu started toying with
        the idea of automating game setups. He spent a few days learning
        Python and GTK to make a launcher for TES: Oblivion but then wanted to apply
        the same principle to any game playable on Linux. In late 2009, after picking the
        otter as the project’s mascot, Lutris was born…
