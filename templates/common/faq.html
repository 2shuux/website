      <h2>General</h2>
      <h3 id='faq-sell-games'>Does Lutris sell games?</h3>
      <p>
        No, we don't sell commercial games on the platform, Lutris allows you
        to install and play games purchased on a variety on different game stores such as
        Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Battle.net, etc…
      </p>
      <h3 id='faq-game-dev'>I'm a game developer, can I publish my game on Lutris?</h3>
      <p>
        You can create a page for your game and submit an installer for it but
        right now there aren't any special features for game developers. We do
        have some plan to add a game developer role to the website, you can
        follow its development here: <a
          href='https://github.com/lutris/website/issues/83'>on Github</a>
      </p>
      <h3 id='faq-runtime'>What is the Lutris runtime?</h3>
      <p>
        The Lutris runtime is a collection of libraries we automatically
        provide to ensure compatibility with all games and runners over all
        Linux distributions. The runtime itself is composed of parts of the <a
          href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">Steam
          runtime</a>, some Ubuntu 16.04 libraries and a few extra libraries
        from various places.<br/>
        Of course, ensuring binary compatibility over all existing Linux
        distributions is not an easy task and sometimes issues will arise. If
        such a thing happen, try disabling the runtime in the system options of
        your game. For more details on the runtime, see the <a
          href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Lutris-Runtime">wiki</a>.

      <h2>Runners</h2>
      <h3 id='faq-runner'>What is a "Runner"?</h3>
      <p>
        A "runner" is the term we use to refer to programs that can run games,
        it can be Linux itself, Wine, DOSBox, MAME, gzdoom, …
        Runners are recognized as such in Lutris itself, not all programs that
        run games are considered runners. For example Darkplaces, the open
        source engine for Quake is not a runner but gzdoom is. Usually,
        programs become runners if they can run a variety of games, not just
        one or two.
      </p>
      <h3>I want to use your runners but I don't care for Lutris itself</h3>
      <p id='faq-download-runners'>
        Aww, that's too bad… :( But don't worry! All our runner builds are
        freely downloadable from <a
          href="https://lutris.net/files/runners/">here</a>.

      <h2>Wine games</h2>
      <h3 id='faq-wine-versions'>How do I change the Wine version used in a game?</h3>
      <p>
        If you already have a version of Wine installed, you should see a Wine
        entry on the sidebar, you can right click on it then select "Manage
        versions". From there you can install or remove any Wine build we
        provide. The wine versions are downloaded to <code>~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/</code>
      </p>
      <h3 id='faq-wine-resolution'>The resolution is messed up, how can I fix that?</h3>
      <p>
        Resolution switching for Wine games heavily depends on your hardware
        and your desktop environment and also the game itself.<br/>
        If you are experiencing issues, try using a virtual desktop in the Wine
        runner options then start the game and set it to use your monitor's
        native resolution. Once the game is using your native resolution, you
        should be able to turn off the virtual desktop.
      </p>
      <h3 id='faq-overwatch'>I'm just here for Overwatch, don't care about anything else</h3>
