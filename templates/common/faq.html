      <h3>Does Lutris sell games</h3>
      <p>
        No, we don't sell commercial games on the platform, Lutris allows you
        to install and play games purchased on a variety on different game stores such as
        Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Battle.net, etcâ€¦
      </p>
      <h3>I'm a game developer, can I publish my game on Lutris</h3>
      <p>
        You can create a page for your game and submit an installer for it but
        right now there aren't any special features for game developers. We do
        have some plan to add a game developer role to the website, you can
        follow its development here: <a

    <h3>Wine games</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>The resolution is messed up, how can I fix that?</h3>
      <p>
        Resolution switching for Wine games heavily depends on your hardware
        and your desktop environment and also the game itself.<br/>
        If you are experiencing issues, try using a virtual desktop in the Wine
        runner options then start the game and set it to use your monitor's
        native resolution. Once the game is using your native resolution, you
        should be able to turn off the virtual desktop.
