<h3 class="text-primary">General</h3>
<hr class="border-primary"/>
<h4 id='sell-games' class="text-primary">Does Lutris sell games?</h4>
<p>
  No, we don't sell commercial games on the platform, Lutris allows you
  to install and play games purchased on a variety of different game stores such as
  Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Battle.net etc.
</p>

<h4 id="community" class="text-primary">How do I get in touch with the Lutris community?</h4>
<p>
  If you want to ask questions about Lutris or just hang out with other Lutris users, you can join the
  <a href="{{ DISCORD_URL }}">#lutris channel on the Linux_Gamers_Group Discord</a> or our IRC channel
  <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/lutris">#lutris on freenode.org</a>.
  You can also use the <a href="https://forums.lutris.net/">forums</a> to ask questions.
  Please do not privately contact Lutris developers for tech support, do not report issues by email or by
  private message. Bug reports have to stay visible to the community.
</p>

<h4 id="gnome" class="text-primary">Is the Gnome desktop a dependency of Lutris?</h4>
<p>
  No, not at all. The confusion comes from a library we ship
  unfortunately named gnome-desktop, which is not the whole Gnome desktop
  but a collection of utilities that are frequently used within the Gnome
  desktop. This library is used by the Lutris client to support
  resolution switching on Wayland.  This library itself is small and has
  few dependencies.<br/>
  You can install and use Lutris on any desktop environment. Installing
  the client won't install other Gnome components.
</p>

<h4 id="ssl-issue" class="text-primary">Runners and other Lutris provided files fail to download</h4>
<p>
  There seems to be some issues with CloudFlare and some ISPs (notably in
  Turkey) when using older versions of libssl.<br>
  <br>
  A quick workaround so is to run lutris with <code>env LC_ALL=C
    lutris</code> but a more reliable solution is to update your version of libssl.
  The following repositories provide libssl 1.1.1.<br>
  On Ubuntu 18.04 based systems:<br>
  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mgrocock/openssl</code><br>
  On Ubuntu 16.04 based systems:<br>
  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:carsten-uppenbrink-net/openssl</code>
</p>

<h4 id="game-dev" class="text-primary">I'm a game developer, can I publish my game on Lutris?</h4>
<p>
  You can create a page for your game and submit an installer for it but
  as of now there aren't any special features for game developers. We do
  have some plans to add a game developer role to the website, you can
  follow its development <a href='https://github.com/lutris/website/issues/83'>on Github</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="runtime" class="text-primary">What is the Lutris runtime?</h4>
<p>
  The Lutris runtime is a collection of libraries we automatically
  provide to ensure compatibility with all games and runners over all
  Linux distributions. The runtime itself is composed of parts of the
  <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">Steam runtime</a>,
  some Ubuntu 16.04 libraries and a few extra libraries
  from various places.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, ensuring binary compatibility over all existing Linux
  distributions is not an easy task and sometimes issues will arise. If
  such a thing happens, try disabling the runtime in the system options of
  your game. For more details on the runtime, see the <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Lutris-Runtime">wiki</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="game-crash" class="text-primary">Game [x] crashes, what should I do?</h4>
<p>
  First run Lutris from a command line to see potential errors from the game.
  If you see errors related to Linux libraries, try running the game with
  the <a href='#runtime'>runtime</a> disabled. If disabling the
  runtime fixes the issue, please, notify the developers, we don't want
  to ship a broken runtime and your input can help in fixing it.
</p>
<p>
  If your game still doesn't launch try collecting as much info about
  your setup (name of the game, your graphics drivers, Linux distribution,
  hardware setup, desktop environment, etc.) and explain your issue to the
  <a href="#community">community</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to troubleshoot the issue yourself, there are some good
  resources you can look into. Start by looking up the game on
  <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com">PCGamingWiki</a>. You might run
  into a known problem and they might have a workaround.
</p>
<p>
   If you are trying to run a Windows game, also check out
  <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/">WineHQ's AppDB</a> or look for
  issues other Windows users are running into, in the Steam forums for
  example.
</p>


<h4 id="url-handler" class="text-primary">Clicking "Install" on the website's games doesn't do anything.</h4>
<p>
  Some distributions do not configure URL handlers
  correctly, this is not an issue with Lutris, the same thing will happen
  with, for example, the Steam client.
</p>
<p>
  To fix this issue, you can set <code>network.protocol-handler.expose-all</code> to
  <strong>False</strong> in Firefox's about:config. With that flag disabled, you will now
  see a pop-up when clicking "Install", prompting you to choose a program
  to open the URL with. It is recommended you use <code>/usr/bin/xdg-open</code> to
  handle lutris: <br> (or steam:) urls.
</p>

<h3 class="text-primary">Runners</h3>
<hr class="border-primary"/>
<h4 id="runner" class="text-primary">What is a "Runner"?</h4>
<p>
  A "runner" is the term we use to refer to programs that can run games,
  it can be Linux itself, Wine, DOSBox, MAME, gzdoom, â€¦
  Runners are recognized as such in Lutris itself, not all programs that
  run games are considered runners. For example Darkplaces, the open
  source engine for Quake, is not a runner but gzdoom is. Usually,
  programs become runners if they can run a variety of games, not just
  one or two.
</p>

<h3 class="text-primary">Wine games</h3>
<hr class="border-primary"/>
<h4 id="wine-systemwide" class="text-primary">Wine is broken / I have dependency issues.</h4>
<p>
  While Lutris can use a wide selection of Wine builds that we provide
  ourselves, it is strongly encouraged to have Wine installed from your
  operating system's package manager. This ensures that all required Wine
  dependencies are present on the system and will produce better results
  when using Lutris builds.
</p>

<h4 id="wine-patches" class="text-primary">Some game requires a custom patch to work properly.</h4>
<p>
  Lutris provides custom builds of wine to increase the number of playable games.
  If there are patches out there that makes some game playable and we do
  not distribute them, you can ask us to build it.
</p>
<p>
  In order to build a patched version of Wine, we currently need a git
  repository containing the fully patched source tree of Wine. If your
  patches rely on Wine Staging, make sure to apply those as well.
  Once you have patched Wine you can push it to a git repository of your
  choice and notify the moderation team so we can publish the build.
</p>


<h4 id="wine-versions" class="text-primary">How do I change the Wine version used in a game?</h4>
<p>
  If you already have a version of Wine installed, you should see a Wine
  entry on the sidebar, you can right click on it then select "Manage
  versions". From there you can install or remove any Wine build we
  provide. The wine versions are downloaded to <code>~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/</code>
</p>

<h4 id="wine-res" class="text-primary">The resolution is messed up how can I fix that?</h4>
<p>
  Resolution switching for Wine games heavily depends on your hardware
  and your desktop environment as well as the game itself.
</p>
<p>
  If you are experiencing issues, try using a virtual desktop in the Wine
  runner options then start the game and set it to use your monitor's
  native resolution. Once the game is using your native resolution, you
  should be able to turn off the virtual desktop.
</p>

<h4 id="winemenubuilder" class="text-primary">I get winemenubuilder.exe errors in the console output</h4>
<p>
  You shouldn't worry about those. We explicitly disable winemenubuilder
  at runtime so it doesn't mess with your Linux desktop's file type
  associations. Any error related to winemenubuilder can be safely
  ignored.
</p>

<h4 id="overwatch" class="text-primary">I'm just here for Overwatch, don't care about anything else</h4>
<p>
  Please refer to the following article <a
    href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Overwatch">on the
    Github wiki</a>.
