        No, we don't sell commercial games on the platform, Lutris allows you
        to install and play games purchased on a variety of different game stores such as
        Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Battle.net etc.

      <p>
        You can create a page for your game and submit an installer for it but
        as of now there aren't any special features for game developers. We do
        have some plans to add a game developer role to the website, you can
        follow its development <a href='https://github.com/lutris/website/issues/83'>on Github</a>.

            <text x="0" y="25" fill="#BBB">What is the Lutris runtime?</text>
          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Lutris runtime is a collection of libraries we automatically
        provide to ensure compatibility with all games and runners over all
        Linux distributions. The runtime itself is composed of parts of the
        <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">Steam runtime</a>,
        some Ubuntu 16.04 libraries and a few extra libraries
        from various places. <br>
        Of course, ensuring binary compatibility over all existing Linux
        distributions is not an easy task and sometimes issues will arise. If
        such a thing happens, try disabling the runtime in the system options of
        your game. For more details on the runtime, see the <a
          href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Lutris-Runtime">wiki</a>.

        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        First run Lutris from a command line to see potential errors from the game.
        If you see errors related to Linux libraries, try running the game with
        the <a href='#faq-runtime'>runtime</a> disabled. If disabling the
        runtime fixes the issue, please, notify the developers, we don't want
        to ship a broken runtime and your input can help in fixing it. <br>
        If your game still doesn't launch try collecting as much info about
        your setup (name of the game, your graphics drivers, Linux distribution,
        hardware setup, desktop environment, …) and explain your issue to the
        <a href="#faq-community">community</a>. <br>
        If you want to troubleshoot the issue yourself, there are some good
        resources you can look into. Start by looking up the game in
        <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com">PCGamingWiki</a> as you might run
        into a known problem and they might have a workaround. <br> 
        If you are trying to run a Windows game, also check out
        <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/">WineHQ's AppDB</a> or look for
        issues other Windows users are running into, in the Steam forums for
        example.

      <p>
        Some distributions do not configure URL handlers
        correctly, this is not an issue with Lutris, the same thing will happen
        with, for example, the Steam client. <br>
        To fix this issue, you can set <code>network.protocol-handler.expose-all</code> to
        <strong>False</strong> in Firefox's about:config. With that flag disabled, you will now
        see a pop-up when clicking "Install", prompting you to choose a program
        to open the URL with. It is recommended you use <code>/usr/bin/xdg-open</code> to
        handle lutris: <br> (or steam:) urls.

          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        A "runner" is the term we use to refer to programs that can run games,
        it can be Linux itself, Wine, DOSBox, MAME, gzdoom, …
        Runners are recognized as such in Lutris itself, not all programs that
        run games are considered runners. For example Darkplaces, the open
        source engine for Quake, is not a runner but gzdoom is. Usually,
        programs become runners if they can run a variety of games, not just
        one or two.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Aww, that's too bad… :( But don't worry! All our runner builds are

      <h2>Wine games</h2>
      <h3>

            <text x="0" y="25" fill="#BBB">Wine is broken / I have dependency issues.</text>
          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While Lutris can use a wide selection of Wine builds that we provide
        ourselves, it is strongly encouraged to have Wine installed from your
        operating system's package manager. This ensures that all required Wine
        dependencies are present on the system and will produce better results
        when using Lutris builds.
      </p>

            <text x="0" y="25" fill="#BBB">Some games require a custom patch to work properly.</text>
          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Lutris provides custom builds of wine to increase the number of playable games.
        If there are patches out there that makes some game playable and we do
        not distribute them, you can ask us to build it. <br/>
        In order to build a patched version of Wine, we currently need a git
        repository containing the fully patched source tree of wine. If your
        patches rely on Wine Staging, make sure to apply those as well.
        Once you have patched Wine, you can push it to a git repository of your
        choice and notify the moderation team so we can publish the build.

          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you already have a version of Wine installed, you should see a Wine
        entry on the sidebar, you can right click on it then select "Manage
        versions". From there you can install or remove any Wine build we
        provide. The wine versions are downloaded to <code>~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/</code>
      </p>

          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Resolution switching for Wine games heavily depends on your hardware
        and your desktop environment as well as the game itself.<br/>
        If you are experiencing issues, try using a virtual desktop in the Wine
        runner options then start the game and set it to use your monitor's
        native resolution. Once the game is using your native resolution, you
        should be able to turn off the virtual desktop.

          </svg>
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        You shouldn't worry about those. We explicitly disable winemenubuilder
        at runtime so it doesn't mess with your Linux desktop's file type
        associations. Any error related to winemenubuilder can be safely
        ignored.
