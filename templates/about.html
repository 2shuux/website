    <h3>About Lutris</h3>
    <article>
      <p>
        Lutris is an open gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It aims at supporting
        as many games as possible thanks to emulators and providing a simple
        and reliable experience when installing games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project combines the lutris.net website, a Linux client and game
        runners which are provided by your distribution or by Lutris itself.

    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
    <article>
      <p>
        Lutris should work on any modern Linux platform, the client tries to
        minimize its dependencies and avoid relying on the system package
        manager whenever it can. This allows to keep a predictable behavior
        between different flavors of Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, due to the lack of maintainers for many distributions, Lutris is
        only currently officially supported on current versions of Ubuntu and
        Fedora. Maintainers for every other distributions are more than welcome.
